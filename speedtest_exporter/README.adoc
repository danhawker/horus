== Speedtest Exporter

A simple exporter for Prometheus that leverages `speedtest.net` to monitor Internet connectivity upload, download and latency.

Container image code is stored in https://github.com/danhawker/speedtest_exporter

This repo includes a file to run the container as a system container with Podman.

To run the container as a systemd service, simply copy the systemd unit file from the systemd dir to `/etc/systemd/system/` run `systemd daemon-reload` and simply start the service with `systemctl start container-speedtest_exporter.service`
